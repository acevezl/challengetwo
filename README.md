## Responsive Functionality

- Design is responsive and adapts to various devices and screen resolutions. 
- Top navigation adapts to various viewports:
  - _Hamburger menu_ is displayed on smaller resolutions (under 1024px)
    - Menu items on mobile devices occupy the full viewport width and display in a top-down fashion.

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
